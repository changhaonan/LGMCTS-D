Poses are in the form [tx, ty, tz, rx, ry, rz]. First three indices correspond to translation and rest three to rotation.
Based on the given scene, you should plan the sequence of objects like this to make the rearrangement.
The rearrangement when executing will be performed in the order in which you list each obj_id and its corresponding goal pose.
The initial pose you are provided with and goal pose you need to predict are both specified in camera coordinates.
The region bounds (min-max X,Y,Z) for the rearrangement are [[-0.2, 0.2], [-0.4, 0.4], [0.0, 0.5]], again in camera coordinates only.
